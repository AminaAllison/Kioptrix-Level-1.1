<h1>Kioptrix Level 1.1 PenTest Report</h1>


<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
A penetration test was performed on the Kioptrix Level 1.1 machine, which is a vulnerable virtual machine available for practice online. The primary objective of the test was to identify security vulnerabilities and demonstrate the potential impact of a successful exploit. 
<br />
The test revealed several vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, including a remote code execution vulnerability through port 80. This allowed us to gain root access to the system and escalate privileges. 
<br />
I recommend that the identified vulnerabilities be addressed as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of a real-world attack.
<br />


<h2>Methodology</h2>
The penetration test was conducted using a combination of manual and automated techniques, including:
<br />
Port scanning to identify open ports and services
<br />
Vulnerability scanning to identify known vulnerabilities
<br />
Manual testing to identify unique or custom vulnerabilities
<br />
The exploitation of identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the system
<br />


<h2>Findings</h2>
Several vulnerabilities were identified during the penetration test, including:
<br />
Open ports: Port 22 (SSH) and Port 80 (HTTP) were found open on the system, allowing access to these services.
<br />
Remote code execution: A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in the web application running on port 80. This vulnerability allowed us to execute arbitrary code on the system and gain root access.
<br />
Weak password policy: The system allowed weak passwords to be used, making it easier for attackers to guess or brute-force passwords.
<br />


<h2>Exploits</h2>
The remote code execution vulnerability was exploited using a specially crafted payload that was sent to the web application via port 80. This payload allowed us to execute arbitrary code on the system, including a reverse shell that provided root access to the system.
<br />


<h2>Impact</h2>
If these vulnerabilities were exploited by an attacker, they could gain full control over the system and access sensitive information. They could also use the compromised system to launch further attacks on other systems on the network.
<br />


<h2>Recommendations</h2>
I recommend that the following actions be taken to address the identified vulnerabilities:
<br />
Close unnecessary open ports: Close any ports that are not required for the operation of the system.
<br />
Patch known vulnerabilities: Install the latest patches and updates to address any known vulnerabilities.
<br />
Implement strong password policies: Enforce strong password policies to make it more difficult for attackers to guess or brute-force passwords.
<br />


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The penetration test of the Kioptrix Level 1.1 machine demonstrated the potential impact of several vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The identified vulnerabilities should be addressed as soon as possible to mitigate the risk of a real-world attack. I recommend implementing the recommendations outlined above to improve the security of the system.
